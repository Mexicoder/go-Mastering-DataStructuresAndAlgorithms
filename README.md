# Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms

This repository contains my personal solutions and notes for the Udemy course ["Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms"](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/), all implemented in **Go** (Golang).

The primary goal is to gain in-depth knowledge on various data structures and algorithms, enhancing problem-solving skills to ace coding interviews. The secondary goal is to use this opportunity to master Golang, by implementing all the problems and data structures in this language.

## Course Content

This course covers the following topics:

- Array
- Hash Tables
- Singly Linked Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists
- Queues & Stacks
- Trees (BST, AVL Trees, Red Black Trees, Binary Heaps)
- Tries
- Graphs
- Sorting
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming

## Usage

Each topic will have its own directory, and inside those directories, you will find the solutions to the problems given in the course, along with some notes I have made during my study - all implemented in Golang.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for my personal use - to keep track of the progress I'm making in the course, and it's not expected to accept contributions. However, if you spot an error or an area that could be improved, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
